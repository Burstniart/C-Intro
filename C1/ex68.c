/* Exercise 1-6. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

Exercise 1-7. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

Exercise 1-8. Write a program to replace each tab by the three-character sequence >, backspace, -, which prints as >, 
and each backspace by the similar sequence <. This makes tabs and backspaces visible.
